    <p>“Jonathan has represented our school appeals for the past 5 years. I find him very reliable and he 
takes the pressure off me by liaising with Surrey School Appeals to arrange dates directly with them. 
Once I have prepared the paperwork, he sends me a list of questions he has in preparation for the 
appeals in advance which helps a lot on the day as then he doesn’t often have to call and stop the 
appeal. He has a very good success rate in our appeals and we will continue to use him for this year 
again. I have no hesitation in recommending Jonathan to your school”</p>
