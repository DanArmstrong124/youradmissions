        1. The submission of the online booking form confirms that the terms and conditions below have been read, and that the Headteacher of the school is in agreement with them.<br><br>
        2. The online booking form should only be completed once a date has been agreed via email.<br><br>
        3. All lodged appeals and relevant paperwork should be shared with Your Admissions as quickly as possible after an appeal is lodged, and any further requests for information should be responded to within 2 working days.<br><br>
        4. Invoices will, where possible, be issued on the morning after the final appeal is heard, and are due to be paid within 15 days of being issued.<br><br>
        5. Receipts for invoices paid will be issued upon request.<br><br>
        6. Data Protection - The information which you give when providing details of appeals will be used confidentially and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and for the following purposes: preparation and submission of the case of the admission authority relating to appeals lodged, representation of the case of the admission authority at school appeal hearings. The information will be kept securely, and will be kept no longer than necessary.<br><br>
        7. *The price paid is for the number of appeals still outstanding on the due date for papers to be submitted to the Local Authority (e.g. 10 working days before the hearing). Any appeals settled or withdrawn after this date will be included in the total.<br><br>
        8. When more than one year group is being appealed for, a separate statement must be written for each year group, therefore where multiple appeals are lodged across different year groups at the same school, a price must be agreed in advance via email and will be done so on a case by case basis.<br><br>
